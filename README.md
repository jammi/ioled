# About
This utility converts your keyboards's capslock led to a disk access indicator led. It only works on OS X and requires the use of fs_usage, which in turn requires root privileges. Hence, run with sudo or suggest some other method of monitoring disk access.

# Installation
`gem install ioled`

# Usage
`sudo ioled`
